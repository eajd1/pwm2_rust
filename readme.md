This is a personal project for learning rust and partly trying out the tcp stream.
It is a continuation of a project that I started making because I didn't want to pay for a password manager.
I can give no guarantees on the security of messages encrypted using this program.

Encryption/Decryption is achieved by taking a SHA512 hash of a given password and xoring that with the plain text.
